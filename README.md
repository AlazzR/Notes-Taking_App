# Notes-Taking_App

I am almost finished with this project but I want still to add the following features:-

	* Allow real time communication using SignalR between the users when they interact with other users in the comment and note section.
	* To make the frontend more aesthetically pleasing.
	* To allow users to upload their profile images.
	* Adding the relation between users based on frequency of words and to incorporate D3.js for chartign purposes.

After finishing the above I will upload a video to my youtube video, but if you want to see it in action, you can visit the following link:- [note-taking-app-using-nodeJs](https://github.com/AlazzR/CLRS-Introduction-to-Algorithm/tree/master/Web-Development-Training/Note_Taking_with_Flask_and_Node). In which it is the same project but I used node.js for the backend and handlebars as the templating language for the frontend.
