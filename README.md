# Notes-Taking_App

I am almost finished with this project but I want still to add the following features:-
	* Allow real time communication using SignalR between the users when they interact with other users in the comment and note section.
	* To make the frontend more aesthetically pleasing.
	* To allow users to upload their profile images.
	* Adding the relation between users based on frequency of words and to incorporate D3.js for chartign purposes.

After finishing the above I will upload a video to my youtube video, but if you want to see it in action, you can visit the following link:- . In which it is the same project but I used node.js and handlebars.
